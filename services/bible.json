      "Also, if a garment has a leprous plague in it, whether it is a woolen garment or a linen garment,",
      "whether it is in the warp or woof of linen or wool, whether in leather or in anything made of leather,",
      "and if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the leather, whetier in the warp or in the woof, or in anything made of leather, it is a leprous plague and shall be shown to the priest.",
      "The priest shall examine the plague and isolate that which has the plague seven days.",
      "And he shall examine the plague on the seventh day. If the plague has spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, in the leather or in anything made of leather, the plague is an active leprosy. It is unclean.",
      "He shall therefore burn that garment in which is the plague, whether warp or woof, in wool or in linen, or anything of leather, for it is an active leprosy; the garment shall be burned in the fire.",
      "But if the priest examines it, and indeed the plague has not spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in anything made of leather,",
      "then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which is the plague; and he shall isolate it another seven days.",
      "Then the priest shall examine the plague after it has been washed; and indeed if the plague has not changed its color, though the plague has not spread, it is unclean, and you shall burn it in the fire, it continues eating away, whether the damage is outside or inside.",
      "If the priest examines it, and indeed the plague has faded after washing it, then he shall tear it out of the garment, whether out of the warp or out of the woof, or out of the leather.",
      "But if it appears again in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in anything made of leather; it is a spreading plague; you shall burn with fire that in which is the plague.",
      "And if you wash the garment, either warp or woof, or whatever is made of leather, if the plague has disappeared from it, then it shall be washed a second time, and shall be clean.",
      "This is the law of the leprous plague in a garment of wool or linen, either in the warp or woof, or in anything made of leather, to pronounce it clean or to pronounce it unclean."
